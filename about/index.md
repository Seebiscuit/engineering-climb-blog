I never meant to be a coder. 

Coding, hapened to me. Like so many of us in the field, once I took a sip from the cup of automation, I was hooked. For a lot of, I surmise, programming starts with a scripting language. It could be python, javascript, bash (shell scripting languages), and we learn that we can have machines do stuff for us. Then, we learn that most things need a fair amount of debugging. We hunker down and we bang our heads against the handiest wall, and do that enough that we get things to work and the feeling is...just amazing! And before we know it, we're slaves to the machine.

The next thing that&mdash;hopefully&mdash;happens is that we transition towards Software Engineering. What's the difference? A working description I find handy comes from Fred Brooks (who wrote one the seminal book on the philosophy (and practice) of software engineering, [Mythical Man-Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959/)). To parphrase violently, so many great ideas are born from two guys in a garage, so why don't we split big orgs into two-people groups and stick them in a damp, cramped place? Because ideas that come from the garage, while they may be ground-breaking, they are missing the many layers of polish that are required to make them into commercial applications. Brooks estimates that the cost of making commercial grade-software is about 9 times greater than the cost of making garage-ware.

Engineering is the discipline of applying science to real life problems. As software engineers we are concerned with the set of software product best-practices to solve a business problem. That's pretty broad, but in practice software engineers can be responsible for architecture, estimation, construction, and provisioning. 

The first reaction many folks may have when they read that last sentence is that, outside construction, which is the literal act of coding, most of us may not really have much training. And for the engineers amongs us that sort of stumbled into software engineering, that's largely true. Architecting, estimating and provisioning are often arts that come later, if at all, in our careers. 

My interest in laying down the characters you'll see in this site is to share and expose those topics that take us from the realm of coding to the field of engineering. Some of the topics may seem foreign, but the advice folded into the posts should sound reasonable and compelling. If I do my job right, you'll be inspired to pore deeper into the art of crafting reliable software that's delightful to create and use.

I never meant to be a code, but I'm really serious about software engineering.
